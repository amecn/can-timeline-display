# can-timeline-display
Graphical-only utility for displaying how messages are sent over a CAN bus

[**Available online here**](https://amecn.github.io/can-timeline-display/)

Again, this is only graphical, it just displays what it's told to without logic.

This automatically generates HTML and associated style to achieve such output:

Thinner lines mean the message is waiting during that time, big blocks represent times during which messages are sent. Text includes message id and length. Number labels indicate time where useful (message ready, sent start, sent finished).

The above is generated by the default following script:

```js
timeScale(3)
timeOrigin(40)

m(1, 40, 40, 55);
m(2, 60, 40+55, 63);
m(3, 40+55+63+1, 40+55+63+72, 58);
m(4, 40, 40+55+63, 72);

moveTimeY(60, -40);
moveTimeY(95, -40);
moveTimeX(158, -15);
moveTimeX(159, 8);
moveTimeY(159, -50);
moveTimeY(288, -60);

color(4, 'yellow', 'orange', 'black');
```

Scripts are written in JavaScript and work with JavaScript's eval()

## Usage
[Go to the page](https://amecn.github.io/can-timeline-display/) and start modifying the script. It is JavaScript, all language features can be used as well as ignored.

It updates live (as you type) unless there's any error. Errors are written in red under the script. If messages tell you to go to the browser console or provide inaccurate information, consider using Firefox.

Time labels are added wherever something happens, for example when a message begins to be sent.

When a script successfully runs, it is saved in local storage and can be restored by clicking the button on top "Restore Last Success Run".

## Available functions
Order of calls does not matter.

#### Add a message
`m(messageId, timeReady, timeSent, length);`
| parameter | details |
| --------- | --------|
| messageId | Message ID (intended >= 1) |
| timeReady | At which time is the message ready to be sent |
| timeSent  | At which time is the message sent |
| length    | How long is the message |

Checks performed:
`timeReady <= timeSent`,
`length > 0`

A thinner line will be displayed from `timeReady` to `timeSent` to indicate the message is waiting being sent, and a full block with message id and length from `timeSent` to `timeSent+length` will be displayed to indicate the time during which the message is sent.

#### Offset a time label
`moveTimeX(time, x);` and `moveTimeY(time, y);`
| parameter | details |
| --------- | ------- |
| time      | Time to move |
| x         | How many pixels to move the label right (can be negative) |
| y         | How many pixels to move the label down (can be negative) |

Labels are automatically created where a message is ready, starts to be sent, or finishes to be sent.

By default, labels are centered on the corresponding time position, which means close labels can overlap.
This allows manually fixing such cases.

#### Add a message color
`color(messageId, delayColor, sendColor, textColor);`
| parameter  | details |
| ---------- | ------- |
| messageId  | Message ID |
| delayColor | Color for the time during which the message is ready and waits to be sent |
| sendColor  | Color for the time during which the message is sent |
| textColor  | Color for the text describing the message |

By default, messages 1, 2, 3 are red, blue, green respectively, and other messages are black.

#### Time axis settings
`timeScale(scale);` and `timeOrigin(origin);`
| parameter | details |
| --------- | ------- |
| scale     | Scale output horizontally |
| origin    | Use that time as the left-most time |

By default, scale is 1 and origin is 0. Using this on a time that is not labelled will output a red warning but won't interrupt the display update.

Checks performed:
`scale > 0`

## Error handling
In Firefox at least, any error or misuse of the functions will show where the issue is.

Error messages and warnings are written in red below the script input.

All errors apart from useless `moveTime()` calls abort the display update operation.

Some functions perform more checks than described here. All failed checks are errors.

## Examples
```js
// m1 ready and sent at 0, length 55
m(1, 0, 0, 55);
// m2 ready at 30 and sent at 55, length 63
m(2, 30, 55, 63);
```

```js
m(1, 0, 0, 55);
// this time m2 is ready just before m1 finishes being sent
m(2, 50, 55, 63);
// fix labels 50 and 55 overlapping by moving 55 down
moveTimeY(55, 15);
```

```js
m(1, 0, 0, 55);
// this time m2 is ready just before m1 finishes being sent
m(2, 50, 55, 63);
// fix labels 50 and 55 overlapping by moving 55 down
moveTimeY(55, 15);
```

```js
// this time m1 and m2 are sent as soon as they're ready, at 2500 and 2600
m(1, 2500, 2500, 55);
m(2, 2600, 2600, 63);
// change origin to where the messages are
timeOrigin(2500 );
```

```js
// this time m1 and m2 are very far apart
m(1, 0, 0, 55);
m(2, 2500, 2500, 63);
// change scale to see the two messages
timeScale(1/5);
```
